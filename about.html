            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My journey as a web developer began in 2020. Self-taught and driven by curiosity, I delved into the world
                of coding, starting with basic HTML and CSS. Over the years, I expanded my skill set to include PHP and
                JavaScript, and now I'm proficient in creating dynamic and responsive websites.</p>
            <p>From building my first static webpage to developing complex web applications, every project has been a
                step forward in my learning journey. I'm passionate about coding, and my hard work and dedication are
                reflected in every line of code I write.</p>
